Such ecology facilitates the conversion of content and business, giving birth to the unique “grass-planting economy” (meaning recommendation-based business)., After 10 years of development, we are now mainly involved in three business segments: Content community, Brand marketing and E-commerce transactions and are seeing rapid growth in user scale and closer connectivity.As of December 2022, our platform has garnered over 260 million monthly active users, 20+ million monthly active creators, and 3 million releases of notes on a daily basis.With an ever-accumulating UGC content asset, Xiaohongshu is increasingly becoming a zone featuring diverse lifestyles and a life encyclopedia for users across generations.
